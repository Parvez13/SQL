# SQL

SQL is Structured Query Language. It is the query language used to retrieve data from our database.

There are types of SQL:
  -  Data Definition Language (DDL)
  -  Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  -  Data Control Language(DCL)
  -  Transaction Control Language(TCL)
  -  Data Query Language (DQL)

The SQL is used to write queries in the database(collection of data).
There five types of Database Model

### 1) Relational Database or Relational Database Management Systme(RDMS)
  
  Tables are structured related to each other.Each specific type of domain data is stored it's own table of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called "records" and "tuples". Columns are also called "attributes".
  
### 2) Documents Database

 A document-oriented database or a NoSQL document store is a modern way to store data in JSON format rather than simple rows and columns.
 
### 3) Key Value Database

 A key-value database stores data as a collection of key-value pairs in which a key serves as a unique identifier. 
 
### 4) Graph Database

Graph database map networked objects and provide relationships betweeen different objects. The objects are referred to as nodes, and the connections between them are edges

### 5) Wide-Column Database

A wide-column is a type of NoSQL database. It uses tables, rows, and columns, but unlike a relational database, the names and format of the columns can vary from row to row in the same table. A wide-column store can be interpreted as a two-dimensional key-value store.
